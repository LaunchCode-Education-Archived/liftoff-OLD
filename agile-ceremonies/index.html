                    <p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/ceremonies" target="_blank">Agile ceremonies</a> are types of team communications (i.e. meetings) structured in specific ways meant to enable quick, iterative, efficient, and communicative development cycles. We'll use a few of them in this course.</p>

<h2 id="sprint-kickoff">Sprint Kickoff</h2>
<p>A <strong>sprint</strong> is a time-limited work cycle during which teams focus on delivering as much value as possible. Sprints can have different lengths, but most teams will use 1- or 2-week sprints. We'll go with 2-week sprints in this course. This means that when we're planning the work for a sprint, you should think about how much work you can do in a 2-week timeframe.</p>
<h3 id="prioritization">Prioritization</h3>
<p>Decide which user stories are the most important for you to work on next. Take into consideration any dependencies between stories, while also trying to keep stories as small as possible. This is a great time to clarify and further define user stories. You'll often break up or combine stories during a kickoff meeting.</p>
<h3 id="estimation">Estimation</h3>
<p>Once you've prioritized your stories, you'll need to estimate them in order to get an idea of how much work you'll be able to do during a sprint. When estimating, you'll often need to clarify details with your mentor or with the &quot;product owner&quot; (which in this case is you). Make sure you have a clear understanding of what needs to be done and the scope of work involved.</p>
<p>Using Pivotal Tracker, user stories are estimated in &quot;points&quot;, which are an intentionally subjective unit. After a few sprints, you'll get a good hang of estimation, but the first few times you'll like over- or under-estimate. That's okay! Take note of what you did well and what you could do better during the estimation process and apply it next time.</p>
<p>Here's a rough estimation rubric for using the 0,1,2,3 (Linear) point scale of Pivotal Tracker:</p>
<p><strong>0 points:</strong> Zero-point changes are almost always bug fixes. In the world of agile development, work that doesn't add explicit additional value to a product is not usually not counted or measured. You might also add something inconsequentially small in this category, such as a copy/text change.</p>
<p><strong>1 point:</strong> A small change that, similar to things you have done before and are confident you can do again without having to learn anything new. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding an input to a form</li>
<li>Adding a field to a model class</li>
<li>Adding a static or informational page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2 points:</strong> A medium-sized change that may involve some components that are new to you, or take slightly more time. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable pagination for a listing of blog posts</li>
<li>Adding a simple form, such as one that creates a new instance of a model class (e.g. a blog post)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 points:</strong> A large task with several components. These often entail changes to several views and controllers, or learning something significant and new. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a new model class with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships to other classes</li>
<li>Adding a complicated form, such as registration or login</li>
</ul>
<aside class="aside-pro-tip">
<p>If you estimate a story at 3 points, make sure that you can't break it down into multiple smaller stories.</p>
</aside>
<p>After you have estimated the most important stories, move those that you want to complete into your <em>Current Iteration</em> panel in Pivotal Tracker. All other stories should be in the <em>Backlog</em> (for those you want to work on soon, but not during this sprint), or in the <em>Icebox</em> (for things that you may work on in the future, but are not important in the short-term).</p>
<p><strong>Be frank and honest about how much you work you can do in a sprint!</strong> You'll likely soon learn one of two things: you tend to overestimate work, or you tend to underestimate. Take this self-knowledge to heart, and use it to make yourself a better planner.</p>
<p>The amount of points you complete in a given sprint contributes to your <strong>velocity</strong>. Loosely speaking, velocity is the average number of points that you are able to complete during a sprint, averaged over some number of past sprints. Knowing your velocity can also help you estimate work going forward.</p>
<aside class="aside-pro-tip">
<p>It can be a useful and fun exercises to start your ceremonies with a <a href="http://www.teamfirstdevelopment.com/warm-ups/" target="_blank">warm-up game</a>. These stimulate strong communication and engagement by all members of the team, and also help get creative juices flowing.</p>
<p>Your instructor may have you start your ceremonies with one of the games from the resource linked above.</p>

<h2 id="standup">Standup</h2>
<p>A <strong>standup</strong> is a short status meeting conducted regularly (usually every morning) by agile teams. In its most common format, standups take place by having the entire team stand up near their work area and take turns answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I complete yesterday?</li>
<li>What will I work on today?</li>
<li>Am I blocked by anything?</li>
</ul>
<p>By &quot;blocked&quot; it is meant that you are prevented from working on or completing a task due to a circumstance outside of your direct control. You could be waiting for another team member or an external party to deliver something necessary for you to proceed.</p>
<p>Standups have a few purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Provide a quick, regular structure for communication</strong></p>
<p>When teams need to move quickly, regular and adaptive communication is essential. You shouldn't have to wait for a weekly team meeting, or some other time, to understand what your fellow developers are working on. Maybe you can provide insight on something they're working on, or maybe you're blocking them from moving forward and weren't aware.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage collaborative accountability</strong></p>
<p>When everyone has to report on what they worked on yesterday, nobody wants to be the person that didn't make any progress. Sure, some days will be more productive than others, but it's important that each team member puts their best effort forward to enable the most positive outcome for the team overall.</p>
<p><strong>Brevity and participation</strong></p>
<p>This is why we stand up! Keeping the meeting quick and informal is paramount for optimal efficiency. When teams sit down in a conference room, the tendency is for long, drawn-out meetings where not everyone is equally engaged to take place.</p>
<p>In the context of Liftoff, you will conduct regular standups within your team. While you aren't all working on the same project, you should cover each of the three items above. Here's an adapted rubric to use when it's your turn to report:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I complete last week?</li>
<li>What will I work on next week?</li>
<li>Am I blocked by anything? In other words, is there anything a mentor or fellow learner could help me understand to move forward more quickly?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="retrospective-and-sprint-review">Retrospective and Sprint Review</h2>
<p>Retrospectives and sprint reviews are often carried out as independent activities. However, we'll combine aspects of both in a single activity.</p>
<p>A <strong>sprint review</strong> looks back at the work accomplished during the last sprint. It often includes activities such as demos of new features for the team and product owner (only fully-completed work is demonstrated). Additionally, sprint reviews can function as a celebration of team accomplishments.</p>
<p>A <strong>retrospective</strong> is an activity designed to reflect on what worked well and what didn't. It is often carried out at the end of a sprint, though it isn't always a part of <em>every</em> sprint, the way a sprint review is. In a team environment, a retrospective is often facilitated by somebody that is not on the development team, in order to provide a more neutral structure. Teams discuss big-picture thoughts, process and communication issues, and anything else related to how they can improve and grow as a team.</p>
<p>For Liftoff, you will cap off your sprint by participating in an activity that combines elements of both sprint reviews and retrospectives.</p>
<p>As a team, you will go through the following items. Your mentor will facilitate this discussion.</p>
<ol>
<li>What stories were you able to complete during the last sprint?</li>
<li>Which stories, if any, did you commit to during the last sprint that you were unable to complete? will these carry over to the next sprint?</li>
<li>What can you do to improve workflow for the next sprint? You might discuss topics such as:
<ul>
<li>Improved estimation and prioritization</li>
<li>Time management</li>
<li>Planning (user stories, wireframes, etc)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="facilitation-notes-for-mentors">Facilitation Notes for Mentors</h3>
<p>There are different ways to facilitate this discussion. We recommend going through the first items in a standup fashion. That is, each person reports the completed and uncompleted stories in turn.</p>
<p>For the final portion, it can be useful to have a more open-ended discussion that learners can contribute to. Try to stimulate constructive participation by all learners, and focus on helping them come to their own conclusions. Be sure that the discussion includes concrete steps that learners can take to improve workflow during the next sprint.</p>
