    * Cover the types of technical assessments.
    * Encourage students to continue learning as a way to prepare for technical interviews.
* Setup Technical Interview Activity.
    * Break students into pairs, and have them ask each other questions.
* Allocate time for the project review assignment.

## Student Assignments
* Project Review One
    * [Description](../../../assignments/project-review)
    * Grading Rubric found on Canvas under the Pages section
    * *This assignment needs to be graded by the end of class*
    * Students shouldn't fail this assignment unless they have absoultely nothing to show. It's hard to have a review if they haven't done any work. If they fail report them to the CEM.

## Possible Class Outline
* Agile Sprint Retro
* Technical Interview Presentation
* Technical Interview Activity
* Project Review
* Agile Sprint Kickoff

## Student Struggles
* Students won't do well during the Techncial Interview Presentation.
    * Students might not pair up with another student.
        * Find another student for them to work with or make the odd group of 3 students.
    * Students won't answer questions fully.
        * This activity is meant to practice the Claim Evidence model. Remind students to give examples from their life that back up their answers.
* Students won't do well during the Project Review.
    * Student doesn't know what to expect.
        * Most students won't know what to expect from a project review. Guide them through it. Ask them to see their project, see their code, ask them about the biggest challenge, their favorite part of their project, and what they have had to learn.
    * Students won't have made much progress on their projects.
        * Remind them everyone works at a different speed. They should have made some progress by now, if they have user stories but aren't making progress towards the stories, help them identify why they aren't making progress.
    * Students haven't made any progress towards their projects.
        * If students haven't completed project assignments to this point in the class, and don't have anything in their project to show, fail them and report them to the CEM who can work with them more one on one.
    * Students are afraid they haven't made enough progress.
        * Some students will make good progress, but think it's not enough. Remind them everyone works at different speeds, and help them take pride in what they have accomplished so far.
    * Students have completed work but don't know where to go next.
        * Talk through their project with them. Ask them about their end goal, look over their feature list with them again, and give them the best advice you can for continuing. It sometimes is helping them break a big feature down into smaller steps.
