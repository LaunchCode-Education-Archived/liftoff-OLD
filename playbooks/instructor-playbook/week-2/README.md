* Instructor/Mentor Standup

## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were not good (too large, not specific enough).
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked, you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
* Students will be anxious about live coding.
    * Encourage them to talk out loud, ask questions, and follow the steps.
    * Encourage them to continue practicing on their own and with others outside of class.
* Students won't talk much during live coding.
    * Encourage them to ask questions.
    * Have them talk through their logic, or why they decided to do something.
    * Have them talk through a possible test case and what's happening line by line.
