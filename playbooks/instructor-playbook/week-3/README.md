## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were not good (too large, not specific enough).
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code, or debugging with them.
* Students will gripe and complain about Resumes, LinkedIn, or GitHub.
    * Gently remind them it's part of the required work to find a job especially through LaunchCode.
* Students will not know how to change things on GitHub.
    * Help them out, or point them in the right direction. GitHub has tons of tutorials.
* Students will not have LinkedIn profiles.
    * Help them set one up, or point them in the right direction.
* Students will have poor resumes.
    * Give specific feedback.
* Students will have questions about Licenses.
    * Answer their questions to the best of your abilities; if you don't know how, pass them to the instructor.
