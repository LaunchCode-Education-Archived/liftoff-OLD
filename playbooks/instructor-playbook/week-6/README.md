    * Let them know they will have as many chances as necessary to pass this assignment, and that they can continue to work with the CEM.
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were too large or not specific enough
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
