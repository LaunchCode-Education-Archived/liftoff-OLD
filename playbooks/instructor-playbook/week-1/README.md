## Student Struggles
* Students will *really struggle* with creating good user stories. For the most part they will create far too large of user stories. Press the students, and mentors to break down the stories even more than they already have.
* Studnets will struggle with Project Ideas. For the most part leave this to the mentors, but it's always benefical for you to share your own experiences with small projects.
* Students may have coding paralysis, they have an idea, and user stories, but fail to get anything done. This is almost always due to them not understanding what they need to do for a given user story. Have them break their story down further by outlining their research questions, or what they will need to learn to complete the user story.
