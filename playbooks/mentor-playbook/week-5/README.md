## Your Responsibilities
* Take attendance in Canvas
    * All students should be marked present (check mark), not present (x), or excused (EX)
    * Post in #staff if a student is absent, but scheduled for an interview, so we can update.
* Run a Stand-Up
    * We'll take around 10 minutes to do stand-up before we begin live coding interviews.
    * Make note of any blockers or slow progress to follow up on later.
* Share any interview experiences and answer any questions your group might have.
* Live Coding Interviews
    * See details below
* One on One Project Feedback
    * Once you've completed your interviews, follow up with your group to uncover blockers and clarify next steps.
* Mentor Stand-Up
    * If you need to leave earlier, feel free to share when you can.

## Student Assignments
* Live Coding Interview
    * An interview schedule and rubric will be shared before class
    * [Description](../../../assignments/live-coding)
    * Grading Rubric found on Canvas under the Pages section
    * *This assignment needs to be graded by the end of class* - You should be able to grade any students' assignment.
    * Take notes and give students feedback.

## Student Struggles
* Live Coding
    * Students struggle to communicate their thought process
        * Ask questions like "What's that you're doing there?" or "Can you show me how that works?"
    * Students get stuck finding a solution
        * Encourage them to revisit their pseudocode.
    * Students are stuck on syntax
        * Don't let them get hung up on confusing method names like `length` vs `size`, have them move on.
    * Student's code has a bug
        * Give them ample time to self-identify any bugs.
        * Encourage them to test their code - "How would you verify this?"
