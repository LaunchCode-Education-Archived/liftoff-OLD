title: 'Mentor Playbook: Week 2'
---

## Topics
* User Experience (UX)
* Wireframing
* User Stories Continued
* Agile Ceremonies

## Your Responsibilities
* Take attendance in Canvas
    * All students should be marked present (check mark), not present (x), or excused (EX)
    * Report any unexcused absences to the CEM!
* Facilitate Wireframing Activity (After UX/Wireframe Lecture, before Agile Lecture)
    * Part 1 - Crazy 8's Exercise Facilitated by Instructor. Each student will take one sheet of paper, divide into 8 sections, and spend 1 minute per square sketching their app, starting with their landing page, adding others if exhausted.
    * Part 2 - Students will select ~3 of their favorites to share with a partner, who will provided feedback, and share theirs.
    * Part 3 - Students will work on "full page" wireframes for each page in their application. You should ask students to walk them through their current wireframes
* Run a Sprint Standup (End of class)
    * Remind them what a Sprint Standup is, and how it fits into the Agile ceremonies we are using in this course.
    * Standups are meant to be short. If a student is taking too much time, or is using the standup as a time to get unblocked, move on and loop back to them in free project work time.

## Student Assignments
* Project Planning
    * [Description](../../assignments/project-planning/)
    * Grading Rubric found on Canvas under the Pages section

## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were not good (too large, not specific enough).
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
* Students may not be confident wireframing
    * Work with them in getting started. Ask questions from a user's perspective. "What will I see when I first open your web app?", "How will I create a new cheese?", "Where can I see all of my cheeses?"
