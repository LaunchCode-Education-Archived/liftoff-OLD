## Topics
* User Stories
* Agile Ceremonies
* User Experience (UX)
* Wireframing

## Your Responsibilities
* Take attendance in Canvas
    * All students should be marked present (check mark), not present (x), or excused (EX)
    * Report any unexcused absences to the CEM!
* Lecture 1 - Agile
    * Share any experiences or practices where appropriate
* Activity 1 - (Individual) Run a Sprint Kickoff
    * Have students share brief "elevator pitches" for their capstone
    * Students should also share their "next step" to starting their project - Use this as an indicator if your student is ready and has a well-scoped first story/task.
* Activity 1 - (Group) Run a Sprint Kickoff
    * Have students share what parts of the project they might be interested in. This may help assign roles later.
    * Use this time to (continue) story mapping
    * Encourage students to add user stories to their tracker
* Activity 2 - (Individual) User Story Grooming
    * Encourage Students to pair up to share and groom user stories while you meet one-on-one
    * Touch-base with all your students
        * They have at least one user story written
        * Scope and effort are as small as possible
        * Identify 1+ MVP stories for them to get started on
* Activity 2 - (Group) User Story Grooming
    * Start creating user stories from your story mapping and input into a shared tracker
    * Consider nominating a "scribe" to enter stories
* Lecture 2 - UX & Wireframing
    * Share any experiences or practices where appropriate
* Activity 3 - Fast 8's Warmup
    * Instructor will introduce, but make sure you have enough paper and pens for your group.
    * Individuals will focus on their own project, groups can do Fast 8's together
    * Each student will take one sheet of paper, divide into 8 sections, and spend 1 minute per square sketching a page.
    * Students will select ~3 of their favorites to share with a partner, who will provided feedback, and share theirs.
    * Groups - You can take this one step further and have your students 'dot vote' for 3 features they like, and use that in the next activity.
* Activity 4 - Wireframing
    * Students will begin wireframing their app
    * Touch base with each student to see their progress, providing input as needed
    * Focus heavily on MVP, calling out any extra features. Encourage them to 'backlog' them, but push MVP

## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were not good (too large, not specific enough).
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
* Students may not be confident wireframing
    * Work with them in getting started. Ask questions from a user's perspective. "What will I see when I first open your web app?", "How will I create a new cheese?", "Where can I see all of my cheeses?"
