title: 'Mentor Playbook: Week 4'
---

## Topics
* Agile Standup
* Live Coding

## Your Responsibilities
* Take attendance in Canvas
    * All students should be marked present (check mark), not present (x), or excused (EX)
    * Report any unexcused absences to the CEM!
* Run a Sprint Standup
* Conduct Live Coding Assignment with students
    * For the Live Coding Assignment, you will be given a list of students from another group. You will go through the assignment with them and grade them based on their performance.
* Assist students with their projects.

## Student Assignments
* Live Coding
    * [Description](../../../assignments/live-coding/)
    * Grading Rubric is found on Canvas under the Pages section
        * See the CEM if you can't find it
    * *This assignment needs to be graded by the end of class*
    * If a student fails mark them as a 0 and send their name to the CEM.

## Possible Class Outline
* Agile Standup
* Live Coding Assignment
    * This will take at least 90 minutes
* Free time to work on projects
* Instructor/Mentors standup

## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were too large or not specific enough
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
* Students might fail the Live Coding Assignment.
    * Students sometimes forget it's all about practice
        * Remind them they can attempt the assignment again, and to keep practicing. Give them lots of positive feedback.
    * Students are overly anxious. Sometimes they will completely blank on programming.
        * Don't be afraid of giving them a little assistance. Talk through what you would do for part of the problem to get them talking. If you solve the whole problem for them they should be failed, but if they get going on their own eventually you can pass them.
    * Students struggle with syntax.
        * This isn't a huge issue. Give them some starting syntax, or talk through their logic and mention some ways of doing things correctly. If they don't know *any* syntax, fail them and let the CEM know.
    * Students struggle with programming fundamentals.
        * This is the biggest red flag. If students can't explain what a loop, conditional, variable, or array is they are significantly behind for the Liftoff program. Give them some positive feedback, and report them to the CEM.
