    * Remind students to keep updates brief and focused on what they did, what they're working on, and any blockers
    * Note if student has any blockers or hasn't made any progress to follow up with later
* Facilitate a Resume Workshop
    * If students do not have a resume, encourage them to start based on the Liftoff provided example.
    * Be willing to share your experiences and feedback on resumes, GitHub profiles, and LinkedIn.
    * Give priority to students seeking resume/profile feedback, project work is secondary.
    * If you'd like a second look at a resume, or if you're busy, feel free to send students to the CEM or Instructor
* Assist students with projects
    * Touch base with any students with blockers or who haven't made progress
    * Talk about next steps, encouraging students to update their trackers and groom user stories
* Group Project Mentors
    * Use your best judgement if your group's time would be better spent on group work
    * If in doubt, ask your group what would be more valuable to them

## Student Assignments
* Online Profiles
    * [Description](../../../assignments/online-profiles/)
    * Grading Rubrics found on Canvas under the Pages section
        * See the CEM if you can't find it
    * *This assignment needs to be graded before week 4!*
    * You will have to grade their LinkedIn, Resume, and GitHub profiles, and they all have to be successful for them to pass this assignment.
    * *Students are not required to upload their resume to a public GitHub repository!* If students don't want their information shared publicly they may request to submit their resume in a different way. You can ask them to email/slack you a digital copy, or you can request them to print out a physical copy for you to grade.
    * Similarily students are not required to upload any personal information about themselves to their public facing GitHub or LinkedIn profile. If a student has a problem with uploading personal information you need to respect their wishes. For GitHub, ensure they are still using it appropriately!

## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were not good (too large, not specific enough).
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked, you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
* Students will gripe and complain about Resumes, LinkedIn, or GitHub.
    * Gently remind them it's part of the required work to find a job especially through LaunchCode.
    * Encourage students to use this time with mentors available to get resume feedback
* Students will not know how to change things on GitHub.
    * Help them out or point them in the right direction; GitHub has tons of tutorials.
* Students will not have LinkedIn profiles.
    * Help them set one up, or point them in the right direction.
* Students will have poor resumes.
    * Give specific feedback.
    * Help students uncover any specific strengths or unique perspectives they have, and help them highlight their accomplishments
* Students will have questions about Licenses.
    * Answer their questions to the best of your abilities; if you don't know how, pass them to the instructor.
    * MIT is fairly safe choice.
