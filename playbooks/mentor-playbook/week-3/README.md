    * Open Licenses
* Online Profiles
    * Tech Resume
    * GitHub
    * LinkedIn
* Stand-up

## Your Responsibilities
* Take attendance in Canvas
    * All students should be marked present (check mark), not present (x), or excused (EX)
    * Report any unexcused absences to the CEM!
* Run a group stand-up
    * Hopefully students understand the cadence, but feel free to gently nudge students dragging out their updates
* Facilitate a Resume Workshop
    * Nothing in particular is needed, let students work through their resume and provide feedback
    * Be willing to share your experiences with resumes, GitHub profiles, and LinkedIn.
    * Give priority to students seeking resume/profile feedback, project work is secondary
* Assist students with projects

## Student Assignments
* Online Profiles
    * [Description](../../../assignments/online-profiles/)
    * Grading Rubrics found on Canvas under the Pages section
        * See the CEM if you can't find it
    * *This assignment needs to be graded before week 4!*
    * You will have to grade their LinkedIn, Resume, and GitHub profiles, and they all have to be successful for them to pass this assignment.
    * *Students are not required to upload their resume to a public GitHub repository!* If students don't want their information shared publicly they may request to submit their resume in a different way. You can ask them to email/slack you a digital copy, or you can request them to print out a physical copy for you to grade.
    * Similarily students are not required to upload any personal information about themselves to their public facing GitHub profile. If a student has a problem with uploading personal information you need to respect their wishes, but ensure they are still using GitHub appropriately!

## Student Struggles
* Students might not make much progress towards their user stories.
    * Either their stories were not good (too large, not specific enough).
        * Work with them to create better stories.
    * They are struggling to find time to work on their projects.
        * Have them plan out specific times this week they will work on their project.
    * They aren't skilled enough with languages or technologies they are using.
        * Give them some advice on learning tools, and notify the CEM.
    * They are blocked and need assistance before moving forward.
        * If they are blocked, you can help them! However, try to make sure they aren't reliant on your help to make progress. Try pointing them in the correct direction over writing code or debugging with them.
* Students will gripe and complain about Resumes, LinkedIn, or GitHub.
    * Gently remind them it's part of the required work to find a job especially through LaunchCode.
* Students will not know how to change things on GitHub.
    * Help them out or point them in the right direction; GitHub has tons of tutorials.
* Students will not have LinkedIn profiles.
    * Help them set one up, or point them in the right direction.
* Students will have poor resumes.
    * Give specific feedback.
* Students will have questions about Licenses.
    * Answer their questions to the best of your abilities; if you don't know how, pass them to the instructor.
    * MIT is always a safe choice.
