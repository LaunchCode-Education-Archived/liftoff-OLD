## Student Assignments

    * The grading rubric can be found on the pages tab of Canvas.
    * *This assignment needs to be graded by the end of class*

* Project Deployment [OPTIONAL]
    * [Description](../../../assignments/project-deployment/)
    * This assignment is optional. There will be some students that attempt this assignment and want help. Help them, but not at the expense of students that need help towards required assignments.

## Possible Class Outline
* Agile Retro
* Project Review
* Agile Sprint Kickoff
* Free time for project work, mock interview, and live coding

## Student Struggles
* At this point in time, students should be better at estimating stories and making progress towards them. However, there will still be students that struggle with this. Try to address this in the project review.
* During the project review, some students still won't have made much progress towards their project. This is probably your last chance to help them break down the work into as small of pieces as possible, and to have them work on the smallest piece so that they can get something done before the end of the class.
* Students that attempt the deployment project will inevitably struggle with deploying their project. Help them if you have the time, but make sure you are getting to your students that need help with required assignments.
