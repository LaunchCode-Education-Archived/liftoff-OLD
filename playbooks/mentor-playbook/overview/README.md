title: 'Mentor Playbook: Overview'
---

Thank you for being a Mentor for Liftoff. This 8 week program will help students complete a personal project, prepare for the interview process, and learn new project process skills that will help prepare them for a job as a developer!

This class relies on *you*, the Mentor, heavily. You will act as an Agile coach, a mock interviewer, a resume reviewer, a live coding judge, and you will assist students when they are blocked on projects.

This playbook is intended to help you as you serve students in all of these various roles. Each week is broken down for you, but this will help give you an overview of the entire program.

## Class Logistics
Class meets weekly for 3 hours. Much like LC101, students are given prep-work to complete before each class. *Mentors are required to be at all classes for the entire 3 hours*, you will lead all of the small group activities some weeks these activites take place before the Instructor presentation.

Class consists of a combination of instructor led presentations, small group activities, Agile ceremonies, and free time for students to work on their personal project.

Ultimately, students complete the course by finishing all assignments. Most assignments will be completed by students outside of class, but a couple assignments will be completed during class.

## Course Content
This course is intended to assist students in completing their personal projects, learning new skills, and in preparing for their job search. So content is divided into two different modules. *Project Module* work is intended to help the student make progress towards, and ultimately finish a personal project. *Career Module* work is intended to help the student understand, and prepare for their job search.
