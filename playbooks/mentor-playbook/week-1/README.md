## Student Struggles
* Students will struggle with creating User Stories, and estimating them properly. Try to help them make their user stories as small as possible.
* Students will struggle with their Project Ideas. Some students will go overly ambitious and have an idea they will not be able to create with their current skills. Try to have them focus on building a smaller portion of the project for this program.
    * If students won't budge on project ideas or listen to your advice, notify the CEM who can have a more in depth conversation with them about acceptable projects.
* Students will be confused about submitting assignments. The first assignment has them make a Pull Request to a LaunchCode repo. This is the only time they make a PR, but they will continue to make them throughout the class without submitting assignments correctly. If this is a major problem notify the Instructor, and CEM who can work more with the students on submitting assignments correctly.
* Next step confusion. Some students will not know what to do after having their sprint kickoff -- remind them they need to start making progress on their user stories, and that you expect some of those stories to be completed by next week.
