## Overview

For his Liftoff project, Chris has decided to work on an application movitivated by a need expressed by a nonprofit organization. This page will outline the steps that he follows in developing his project, completing each of the Liftoff assignments along with completing user stories and participating in the weekly agile ceremonies like stand-ups and project kickoffs.

## Week 1

### Sprint 1 Kickoff

Most sprint kickoffs will consist of planning estimating, and committing to user stories to complete during the sprint. Since there are not user stories created yet (we'll do that in week 2) this kickoff is a litle different.

We discussed our project ideas--Chris' for and event log and Paul's for an expense tracker--and got some feedback on how big each project might be to be doable. We also discussed the particular technologies that we'll be using to build our projects.

Finally, we discussed the things that we expect to have to learn along the way, beyond what we already know. Paul will be using a new-to-him framework called Rocket (for the Rust programming language), while Chris has some unknowns around how user authentication will work. He also wants to use [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) which he hasn't done in Spring and will have to learn about.

### Assignment: Project Outline

The [project outline](https://github.com/chrisbay/liftoff-assignments/tree/master/P2-Project_Outline) for Event Log gives an overview of the desired functionality.

## Week 2

### Sprint 1 Standup

During our sprint 1 standup, we discussed our completed project outlines. We also talked about working on wireframes and writing user stories in the coming week, which seem like very doable and clearly-defined tasks now that we have outlines of our projects.

We also discussed some of the research that we have done around the new skills we'll be learning for our projects. Chris did some resarch on using Spring Security, and will be using that to handle login functionality. Paul has done some general reading about the Rocket framework so he is more familiar with it when he starts coding.

### Assignment: Project Planning

The [Project Planning](https://github.com/chrisbay/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/README.md) includes 3 initial wireframes for the Event Log app, along with a link to the Pivotal Tracker project that has been populated with some user stories.
