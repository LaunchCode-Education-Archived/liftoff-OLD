## Practice Makes Perfect
We will be getting some live coding practice in preparation for the live coding assignment.

Remember to make the most of this practice, you need to practice in the same format you will be tested. To do that you need to emulate a live coding session. After you read the problem step away from your computer and work through a solution using a piece of paper, or a white-board. Talk through your ideas, and soultion. Don't forget to hand test your solution, before typing it into your computer.

We provided solutions for all four of the problems. The first two solutions have a break down of the steps you should follow. If you are struggling with this prep work start with the solution to Staircase.
