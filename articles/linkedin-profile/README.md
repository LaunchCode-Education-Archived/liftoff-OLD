### LinkedIn
You can think of your LinkedIn as your digital resume. It should contain your professional experience, skills, and education.

Your github is a great demostration of your technical skills, but is only very benficial to a technical individual. Your LinkedIn should be geared towards the HR department, where you have a chance to further explain things about yourself.

Much like your github profile you want to associate a professional email address with your LinkedIn account, and have a nice looking headshot to include as a picture.

#### Contact Information
Aside from a headshot you should include your contact information: your professional email address, and your phone number.

#### Summary
LinkedIn gives you the ability to write a summary. Most interviewers read this to get a high level understanding of what you are looking to do. So put some passion into writing your summary!

#### Core Skills
LinkedIn has a section dedicated to skills, where you can include some of the hard techncial skills you are searching for, and other soft skills you have accumlated from non-tech education, or experience.

#### History
A great advantage of LinkedIn over a resume is that you can greatly expand upon your work history, or education. You can also use the Social Networking aspect of LinkedIn to connect with past coworkers, and classmates that can verify the skills you include in your profile.
