## Liftoff Overview

Liftoff is an 8 week class with two objectives:

1. You will have completed a significant amount of work towards a project.
2. You will be prepared for the interview process.

Class time will be similar to LC101, you will have prep work before each class, there will be an in class lecture or discussion, in class activities, and assignments which you will be required to work on outside of class.

This class varies from LC101 in the fact that you will be required to perform a lot of unguided work on your project. No one is going to tell you what to build, you will not be given a list of requirements, it will be completely on your shoulders to build your project. We will cover topics that will help you with your project, but you will have to code it yourself.

## Liftoff Expectations

- Class attendance and participation
- Completion of all assignments
- Visible progress on your project every week

Making a project, especially your first independent project, can be a daunting task. You will have to work on your project multiple times a week outside of class, in addition to the prep work, and assignments. We estimate that you will need to work at least **20 hours each week** to make it through this course successfully.
