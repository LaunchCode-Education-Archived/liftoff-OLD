                                        <h1>Technical Resume</h1>
                    <h3 id="resume">Resume</h3>
<p>A resume is a <strong>crucial</strong> part of your job search. We're not going to ramble on explaining what a resume is, because it's a part of the hiring process for most industries. What we will focus on instead is how to create a technical resume that will highlight the skills you bring to a technical position.</p>
<h3 id="technical-resume-format">Technical Resume Format</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a resume we created at LaunchCode to show the format of an ideal technical resume.</p>
<img src="../../images/ada-lovelace-resume.png">
<p>When it comes to the format of your resume, you need to quickly summarize your skills, give evidence of those skills, outline your learning journey so far, and then include everything else you would typically include with a resume.</p>
<p>The clearly outlined sections of a technical resume:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal Information</li>
<li>Summary of Technical Skills</li>
<li>Technical Experience</li>
<li>Technical Education</li>
<li>Other Experience</li>
<li>Other Education</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="personal-information">Personal Information</h4>
<p>You must include your first and last name, a phone number where you can be reached, and a professional email address*.</p>
<p>You should also include a link to your Github profile, a link to your LinkedIn, a physical address, and a link to your personal website (if you have one).</p>
<p>A professional email address is some variation of your name. a.lovelace@gmail.com gives a much more professional feeling than fluffytoes32@yahoo.com. If you don't have an email account for professional communication you should create one, we personally recommend gmail.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-technical-skills">Summary of Technical Skills</h4>
<p>After clearly marking your personal information at the top of the page, the next section is to quickly outline your Technical Skills. You should prioritize programming languages, frameworks, and major libraries over operating systems, and software. You should order your skills from most familiar to least familiar. As a final note you should also consider the type of job you are looking for.</p>
<p>For example: I am looking for a Java back end development job.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nomarkdown">Technical Skills:

Java, Spring, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, MySQL, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.</code></pre>
<p>This selection, and order of skills shows my interviewer that I feel strongest with Java, Spring, and MySQL, then I have less familiarity with Python, and Flask (another back end skill set), and finally that have done a little with front end, and am comfortable using those tools -- but would need a ramp up to do them exclusively.</p>
<aside class="aside-hint">
<p>You should not include every language or technology you've heard of. You should only include skills you would feel comfortable using to build a project today. You've learned the skill, and have some practical experience with the skill. This will usually mean an entry level developer will include fewer than 10 skills on their resume.</p>
</aside>
<h4 id="technical-experience">Technical Experience</h4>
<p>After listing the skills you have, you need to back up your skills with some experience you have gained with those skills. You can do this by mentioning <strong>Projects</strong> you have completed, or by outlining <strong>Professional Experience</strong> that required the use of those skills. Most of you do not have professional experience yet, but you have completed projects. You will want to include projects that used the skills you mentioned in your Technical Skills section.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nomarkdown">Project Experience:
Household Budgeting Web-app -- www.familybudget.com
A web-app that allows users to add members to their household and track incomes and expenses by categories.
    - Java, Spring, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and jQuery
    - Aside from the budget tracking features, it utilizes Spring Security to allow for secure authentication to the web server
    - github.com/mygithubaccount/family-budget

Blogz
A school project completed in LC101, it allows users to signup, create, and read blog posts.
    - Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, MySQL, and HTML
    - Beyond the assigned tasks, I included a feature that allows users to delete, or edit their owned blog posts
    - github.com/mygithubaccount/blogz

Personal Portfolio -- myportfolio.com
A portfolio I am currently building. It will eventually contain links to my other projects, and document what I am currently learning.
    - React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
    - I am currently learning React to incorporate into this project
    - github.com/mygithubaccount/portfolio</code></pre>
<p>You need to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project name</li>
<li>A brief description of the project</li>
<li>Skills used in the project</li>
<li>A key feature of your project</li>
<li>github repo link</li>
</ul>
<p>You should include a live link to your project, if it is online.</p>
<h4 id="technical-education">Technical Education</h4>
<p>You need to show how you learned your technical skills. You can do this by including college courses you have taken, programs you have been a part of, books you have worked through, and MOOC's you have completed.</p>
<aside class="aside-hint">
<p>MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course. This is the majority of your online programs like Udacity, Udemy, EdX, KhanAcademy, etc.</p>
</aside>
<pre><code class="language-nomarkdown">Technical Education:

<h4 id="other-experience">Other Experience</h4>
<p>After covering your technical experiences you still need to include your non-technical work experience.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nomarkdown">Work Experience:
Assistant Manager, Upper Limits
    - Day to day operations of a rock climbing gym, tending register, performing safety inspections, assisting customers, cleaning
    - Worked with Managers to plan, and run special events including Birthday Parties, Corporate Team Building, Climbing Competitions

    - Troubleshoot hardware / software problems for customers, and in house computers</code></pre>
<p>This section can be quite long, depending on the jobs you have had so far. You should try to include as much of it as possible, but focusing primarily on your experiences with problem solving, learning new things on the job, and working with others.</p>
<h4 id="other-education">Other Education</h4>
<p>If you have any other formal education you didn't include in the Technical Education section, you still need to include as it provides invaluable information about you.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nomarkdown">Education:
Webster University, St. Louis, MO
Bachelor of Arts, History with a German minor</code></pre>
<h4 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h4>
<p>Your resume should not be longer than two pages! If it is longer than two pages, try to eliminate sections from your non-technical education or non-technical work experience. If you are still short for room, try reducing the number of bullet points for each item of your resume. Again, you want to focus on showing them your problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Some people like to have a master resume that contains all of the experience, education, skills, and projects they have ever worked on. This a great thing to have for yourself, but when you are sending a professional resume, you don't want it to be longer than two pages. If you can, try to get your resume to one page.</p>
