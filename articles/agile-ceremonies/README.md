[Agile ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/ceremonies) are types of team communications (i.e. meetings) structured in specific ways meant to enable quick, iterative, efficient, and communicative development cycles. We'll use a few of them in this course.

## Sprint Kickoff

A **sprint** is a time-limited work cycle during which teams focus on delivering as much value as possible. Sprints can have different lengths, but most teams will use 1 or 2-week sprints. We'll go with 2-week sprints in this course. This means that when we're planning the work for a sprint, you should think about how much work you can do in a 2-week timeframe.

### Prioritization

Decide which user stories are the most important for you to work on next. Take into consideration any dependencies between stories, while also trying to keep stories as small as possible. This is a great time to clarify and further define user stories. You'll often break up or combine stories during a kickoff meeting.

### Estimation

Once you've prioritized your stories, you'll need to estimate them in order to get an idea of how much work you'll be able to do during a sprint. When estimating, you'll often need to clarify details with your mentor, or with the "product owner" (which in this case is you). Make sure you have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, and the scope of work involved. 

Using Pivotal Tracker, user stories are estimated in "points", which are an intentionally subjective unit. After a few sprints, you'll get a good hang of estimation, but the first few times you'll like over or under-estimate. That's okay! Take note of what you did well and what you could do better during the estimation process and apply it next time.

Here's a rough estimation rubric for using the 0,1,2,3 (Linear) point scale of Pivotal Tracker:

**0 points:** Zero-point changes are almost always bug fixes. In the world of agile development, work that doesn't add explicit additional value to a product is not usually not counted or measured. You might also add something inconsequentially small in this category, such as a copy/text change.

**1 point:** A small change that, similar to things you have done before and are confident you can do again without having to learn anythign new. For example:
- Adding an input to a form
- Adding a field to a model class
- Adding a static or infomrational page

**2 points:** A medium-sized change that may involve some components that are new to you, or take slightly more time. For example:
- Enable pagination for a listing of blog posts
- Adding a simple form, such as one that creates a new isntance of a model class (e.g. a blog post)

**3 points:** A large task with several components. These often entail changes to several views and controllers, or learning something significant and new. For example:
- Adding a new model class with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships to other classes
- Adding a complicated form, such as registration or login

If you estimate a story at 3 points, make sure that you can't break it down into multiple smaller stories.

After you have estimated the most important stories, move those that you want to complete into your *Current Iteration* panel in Pivotal Tracker. All other stories should be in the *Backlog* (for those you want to work on soon, but not during this sprint), or in the *Icebox* (for things that you may work on in the future, but are not important in the short-term).

**Be frank and honest about how much you work you can do in a sprint!** You'll likely soon learn one of two things: you tend to overestimate work, or you tend to underestimate. Take this self-knowledge to heart, and use it to make yourself a better planner.

The amount of points you complete in a given sprint contributes to your **velocity**. Loosely speaking, velocity is the average number points that you are able to complete during a sprint, averaged over some number of past sprints. Knowing your velocity can also help you estimate work going forward.
