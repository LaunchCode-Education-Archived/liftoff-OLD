Interviews can be nerve wracking. Sometimes your anxiety can cause your mind to go blank after an interviewer asks you a question. This in turn might make you even more anxious, and cause you to blank on even more questions! One of the most surefire ways to reduce the anxiety you feel around an interview is to practice. If you feel prepared for your interview a lot of the anxiety you feel will be reduced.

This article will present a strategy for answering interview questions, and give you an example of how you can use this strategy to prepare for your interviews.

If you are more familiar with another strategy for answering interview questions, like the STAR method, feel free to use whichever strategry you are more comfortable with.

## Claim and Evidence
We understand that interviews can be intense, so we want to simplify our strategry as much as possible.

Simply put every question you get in an interview should include at least two things: Your *Claim* and *Evidence* to support your claim.

You don't have a lot of time for every interview question so you want to use your time wisely. A *Claim* is the shortest answer to a given question. It should be very straightforward and address the question. Ideally it is only one, or two sentences.

##### Example Question
"What is your greatest strength?"

##### Example Claim
"My greatest strength is my ability to learn quickly by using mutiple resources."

This claim answers the question directly. Interviewers like to hear a straightforward *claim* as it sets the tone for your answer. The interviewer should not experience any confusion, and have a strong understanding of the message you are trying to convey.

However, as an interviewer hearing a *claim* is not enough. An interviewer is trying to determine how you will behave if they hire you to do the job. The best way they can predict your future behavior is by examining how you behaved in similar situations in the past. They need more than just a *claim* they need you to give an example from your career, education, or life that gives *evidence* to your claim.

Simply put, *evidence* is a story from your experiences that prove your claim is correct.

##### Example Question
"What is your greatest strength?"

##### Example Claim
"My greatest strength is my ability to learn quickly by using mutiple resources."

##### Example Evidence
"For example LC101 requires all students to complete prep-work, attend lectures, participate in group activities, and complete assignments for every chapter. In addition to what LC101 required I also setup an additional study group, and invited all the students from my class to join. Our group of 4 regular members met on Saturday mornings, we would review the concepts covered in course, and we worked through FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development lessons after we had completed our assigned LC101 work. Not only was I challenging myself to learn an additional programming langauge with this new resource, but it helped reinforce the concepts I was learning in LC101. Both Python, and JavaScript use variables, loops, conditionals, data types, functions, etc. Now that LC101 has ended, I've been taking courses on Udemy, and am focusing on learning Angular."

This story contains lots of *evidence* that supports the original claim! This individual is claiming to learn quickly because they use lots of resources. The story they shared mentions Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, LC101, and additional collaboration in an orgainzed small group. They even share some of the specific things they have learned: JavaScript, Python, programming fundamentals, and now Angular. The interviewer can further trust this person's *claim* because they have *evidence* to support the claim.

## Another Example

##### Example Question
"Tell us about a difficul project that you ulitmately failed."

##### Example Claim
"Before I signed up for LC101, I decided to learn programming on my own and tried to make it through CS50x. I was not able to keep up with the pace of the class, and utimately had to withdraw. I learned from this experience and was ablet to adapt some habits that made me successful in LC101."

##### Example Evidence
"When I first started CS50x, I was excited to learn to program, but didn't have any experience with programming. I watched the first lecture, and really enjoyed the Professor, David May, but when I got to the first assignment I didn't feel that I knew how to solve the problem. I waited a couple of days after watching the video, and I struggled with setting up the environment CS50x wanted us to use. By the time I had everything setup, and figured out how to solve the problem I submitted my assignment a few days late. This in turn made me a few days behind starting the next video, and then I was late on the next assignment, and after the first five or so weeks I was overwhelmed and decided to drop the course. I watched the rest of the lectures, but didn't attempt any more assignments. I also found the forums students could use after dropping the course. I can clearly see the problems now, I started the assignments late, I was isolated from my other classmates, I was not using outside resources to help me when I got stuck. So I made sure that when I signed up for LC101 that I started my assignments early, and asked questions often. I started a small study group to make sure I was working with other programmers, and I used outside resources to help me when I was stuck. All three of these changes helped me excel in LC101, and now I feel confident about my programming skills!"

##### Response Breakdown
This claim is a little longer, because they are trying to fully explain the situation. They know the interviewer doesn't want to just hear about a failure, but how they learned from a failure. So they have to both fully explain their failure, and how they learned from that experience. This makes both the *claim* and the *evidence* a little longer.

The *claim* is still short, and to the point, at no time does it stray from the original question.

The story provides lots of *evidence* about what went wrong, what this person learned, and ultimately the steps they took to ensure they didn't fail another learning opportunity.

## Next Steps
In class we are going to have a presentation about the different pieces of the Technical Interview, and will briefly talk about how to answer interview questions. We will then have a small group activity where you will practice asking interview questions to your fellow classmates, and give them feedback. As you give them feedback remember the Claim Evidence Model. Are they answering the question, and giving specific examples from their life? To prepare for this activity, you can begin practicing yousr own responses to interview questions you have encountered in the past!
