## Interview Questions

For this exercise, you will work together to answer interview questions. Each of you will have a list of questions to ask the other person. Go through your questions and give some feedback to your classmate on how they do.

Remember to answer the questions with a Claim-Evidence based model. Back up your answers by giving examples from your experiences so far!

Thinking through answers to interview questions is a great way of preparing for the interview. If you finish your list of questions before the time ends, discuss together other interview questions you've been asked throughout your interviews.

### Question Set One
- What is your greatest strength?
- What was the most difficult part of your project?
- Tell me about the most difficult coworker/customer you have worked with.
- Why did you decide to pursue programming?
- Why do you want to work as a programmer?

### Question Set Two
- What is your greatest weakness?
- What is the most interesting part of your project?
- Tell me about the best team you have been a part of.
- What are you learning right now? What will you be learning next?
- Why do you want to work as a programmer?

### Next Steps
Next week we will have mock interviews during our career module work. This will be a great chance for you to get experience interviewing and is required as an assignment for this course. In preparation for next week, continue to think about interview questions and coming up with answers using a Claim-Evidence based model.
