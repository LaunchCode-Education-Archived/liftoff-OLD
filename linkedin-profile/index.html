<p>You can think of your LinkedIn profile as your digital resume. It should contain your professional experience, skills, and education.</p>
<p>Your GitHub profile is a great demonstration of your technical skills, but it is only very beneficial to a technical individual. Your LinkedIn profile should be geared towards the HR department, giving you a chance to further explain things about yourself.</p>
<p>Much like your GitHub profile, you want to associate a professional email address with your LinkedIn account as well as have a nice looking headshot to include as a picture.</p>
<h4 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h4>
<p>Your contact information should include your professional email address and your phone number.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>LinkedIn gives you the ability to write a summary. Most interviewers read this to get a high level understanding of what you are looking to do. So put some passion into writing your summary!</p>
<h4 id="core-skills">Core Skills</h4>
<p>LinkedIn has a section dedicated to skills. This is the area where you may like to include some of the hard technical skills you are searching for, and other soft skills you have accumulated from non-tech education or experience.</p>
<h4 id="history">History</h4>
<p>A great advantage of LinkedIn over a resume is that you can greatly expand upon your work history and education. You can also use the social networking aspect of LinkedIn to connect with past coworkers and classmates that can verify the skills you include in your profile.</p>
