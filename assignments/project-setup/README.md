This assignment will get you set up and rolling with a basic project. By the end, you will have a GitHub repo that contains a working application.

## Getting Started

The objectives for this assignment are simple to state:

- Create a GitHub repository for your project, which includes a license
- Make an intial commit that includes a basic, working "hello world" level project
- Start working on your first user story

There are some situation-specific tips below. If you have questions about getting started on your project that are not covered here, talk to your mentor or an instructor.

### Pre-existing Projects

If you've already started project, make sure it's in GitHub. Once you check that one off, take the extra step of creating a solid README file that gives a high-level overview of your project, so visitors to your profile can learn about it.

### Java / Spring Boot Project Tips

Revisit [lesson videos](http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/videos/) from the Java / Spring Boot skill track as needed. In particular, if you're starting from scratch you'll find these useful:

- [Intro to Spring Boot: Controllers](http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/videos/intro-to-spring-boot-controllers/) - for creating a basic, "hello world" application
- [Using Git in IntelliJ](http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/videos/using-git-in-intellij/) - for connecting your local Git repository to a GitHub repository

### C# / ASP.NET MVC Project Tips

Revisit [lesson videos](http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-csharp/videos/) from the C# / ASP.NET skill track as needed. In particular, if you're starting from scratch you'll find these useful:

- [Intro to ASP.NET Core MVC: Controllers](http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-csharp/videos/intro-to-mvc-controllers/) - for creating a basic, "hello world" application
- [Intro to Visual Studio](http://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-csharp/videos/intro-to-visual-studio/) - for connecting your local Git repository to a GitHub repository

## Submitting Your Work

Within your `liftoff-assigments` repository, open up `project_03/README.md`. Using Markdown formatting, add a link to your project repository. Then, stage, commit, and push your changes.

Once you have finished both wireframe and user story components, commit and push your changes to your `liftoff-assignments` repository, and submit the assignment on Canvas by submitting the URL to your outline. Your mentor will provide feedback after the assignment deadline.
