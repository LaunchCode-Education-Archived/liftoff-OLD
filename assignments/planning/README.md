For this assignment, you'll create some initial plans for your project, and create your project's repo.

## Getting Started

Within your `liftoff-assignments` repository, open up `P3-Project_Planning/README.md`. You'll see a couple of section headings in place for you. Flesh out your project plan by creating:

1. A wireframe for each page in the MVP of your project, at least 3 total. These can be hand-drawn wireframes that you have photographed using your smartphone, or they can be PDF or image exports from a tool like [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) or Google Drawings. Regardless of how you create them, your wireframes should be clear and readable, and they should be added as files within your Git repository. Be sure to submit following the formatting directives in the README, **which includes adding your images to your repo, along with links to them within the README.** Consult [GitHub's markdown reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as necessary.
1. A link to your _public_ project tracker (e.g. Pivotal Tracker, Trello, GitHub Project). As part of the [class 2 prep](../../class-prep/2/) you created a project tracker and a project. Make sure you have added your MVP user stories, and moved your initial stories into the "TODO" column. You may add additional user stories if you like, putting them in the Backlog or Icebox. Your stories should be clear and formatted as proper user stories and not just todos. They should also have size estimates.
1. Create your initial project repository in GitHub. Don't worry, you can always rename this later. Link this in the above README as well.

## Submitting Your Work

Once you have finished both wireframe and user story components, commit and push your changes to your `liftoff-assignments` repository and submit the assignment on Canvas by submitting the URL to your outline. Your mentor will provide feedback after the assignment deadline.
