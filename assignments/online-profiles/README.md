This assignment requires you to provide us with your resume, Github, and LinkedIn profiles.

## GitHub

Within your `liftoff-assignments` repository, open up `C1-Online_Profiles/README.md`. You will need to add a .PDF of your resume as well as links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile. Your Mentor will then be able to provide you with feedback via GitHub issues.


## Alternate Submission

If you are unwilling to upload your resume to GitHub you will still be resposible for getting your resume to your Mentor to grade. Talk to them in class about the best way to get them your resume. They may have you print out a physical copy, or email/slack them a digital copy, or they may want to see your resume during class.
