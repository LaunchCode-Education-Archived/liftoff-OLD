## Mock Interview

For this assignment, you will go through a mock interview. The mock interview should last between 15-20 minutes, and you will be asked behavioral interview questions.

Your interviewer is going to check that you are answering questions correctly and using experiences from your life as evidence to your answers.

You will not need to submit anything, as your score will be recorded on Canvas for you. If you don't pass the assignment this time, you will need to schedule another mock interview with the course instructor.
