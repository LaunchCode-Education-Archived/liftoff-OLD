For this assignment, you will be required to successfully complete a live coding session with your mentor or LaunchCode staff member. The mentor or staff member will be grading you on your ability to work through the steps, communicate effectively, and work towards solving the problem.

## Scheduling Time

Time will be allocated in class 4; however, you are more than welcome to attempt this assignment multiple times. If you want to take a second, or third, etc attempt, please talk to your Mentor, who can find a time or connect you with a volunteer.

## Practice Makes Perfect

We recommend practicing live coding before attempting this assignment. We will work on live coding twice throughout the Liftoff program in class, but if you would like more practice check out these free websites to find more problems:

## Check Your Grade!

Your Mentor will mark you as complete in Canvas when you complete the exercise. But it is still your responsibility to double check before the class ends.
