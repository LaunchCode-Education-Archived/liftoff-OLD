For this assignment you will be required to successfully complete a live coding session with your mentor, or LaunchCode staff member. They will be grading you on your ability to work through the steps, communicate effectively, and work towards solving the problem.

## Scheduling Time

You will need to finish this assignement before the Liftoff program ends, and you can make multiple attempts if necessary. Your mentor should be able to scheudle a 15-minute time with you, and once you are successful they will mark this assignment as complete.

## Practice Makes Perfect

We recommend practicing live coding before attempting this assignment. We will work on live coding twice throughout the Liftoff program in class, but if you would like more practice check out these free websites to find more problems:
