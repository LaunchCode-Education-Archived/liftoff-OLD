For this assignment you will submit a brief write-up of a local Meetup you have attended. In class we RSVP'd for a Meetup. Once you have attended that meetup you will need to create a brief write-up of the event.

## Outline the Meetup

Within your `liftoff-assigments` repository, open up `career_01/README.md`. You'll see a few sections headings in place for you. Flesh out your project outline by providing:

1. **Name, Date, Time, and Topic**: List the name, date, time, and topic of the Meetup you decided to attend.

2. **Brief description of topic**: In 2-3 sentences write out a brief description of the Meetup topic you completed about the topic at hand.

3. **Questions for Meetup**: List out any questions you may have after doing your research.

4. **Next steps for continuing to learn about the topic**: After attending the Meetup sum up what you learned in 2-3 sentences, and mention where you can go to learn more about the topic.

## Submitting your Write-up
After you have attended your meetup and completed your write-up commit and push your changes, and submit the assignment on Canvas by submitting the URL to your write-up.
