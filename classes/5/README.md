## Career Module: Interview Presentation

We will be learning about the technical interview today, and have a presentation that covers many topics.

### Career Module: Interview Groupwork

For today's group work we will be breaking into pairs and taking turns asking each other [interview questions](../../articles/interview-questions/). 

## Project Module

Your focus for the project module this week, and going forward, should be on making as much progress on your project as possible each week. If you have completed the user stories you planned in a given sprint, pull more stories from your backlog/icebox. If your backlog/icebox is full, write more user stories.

## Agile: Sprint Retrospective
To finish the current sprint you'll participate in a [sprint review and retrospective](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#retrospective-and-sprint-review) facilitated by your mentor.

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you completed this sprint.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you were unable to complete this sprint.
- What you learned about your own work flow.

## Project Review

During class, you'll complete the [Project Review assignment](../../assignments/project-review/) by discussing your project status with your mentor.

## Agile: Sprint Kickoff

To get started on your next sprint, go through the [sprint kickoff](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#sprint-kickoff) activities of prioritization and estimation. If you have user stories in your icebox, begin prioritizing the ones that need to be completed this sprint. If you don't have user stories in your icebox take some time to write new user stories.

You'll then get together with your group. Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you are planning on completing this sprint.
- The prioritization of the user stories you selected this sprint.
- X user stories you plan on having completed before the standup next week.
