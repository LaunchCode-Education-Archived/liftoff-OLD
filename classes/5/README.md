## Project Module: Project Progress

Your focus for the project module this week, and going forward, should be on making as much progress on your project as possible each week. If you reach a point where you have finished all of your pending user stories you should write more.

### Activity: Standup

Before jumping into the Live Coding assignment we have scheduled for class today. Have your standup meeting. Everyone go around state what you completed last week, and what you are working on this coming week.

Remember that to be marked present on attendance you must be able to show *at least one user task you completed* this previous week

### Regroup: Live Coding Setup

For our live coding assignment you have been randomly assigned to a different mentor, instructor, or volunteer who will administer your live coding assignment.

The instructor will introduce the activity, tell you where everyone is working, and share the list of live coding evaluators and students.

### Activity: Live Coding Assignment

After the instructor introduction the evaluators will begin calling names of people they are working with. Keep an ear out for your name to keep things moving along smoothly.

This assignment will take the majority of class time, however you will only spend 10-15 minutes performing your indiviudal live coding assignment. Use the rest of your class time to work on your project, or other assignments.

You will have a chance to make up this assignment if you don't pass today. We want to make sure you are comfortable with this process so you can retake this assignment as many times as you need. Remember practice makes perfect!
