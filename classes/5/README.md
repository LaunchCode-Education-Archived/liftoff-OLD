## Project Module

### Sprint Review and Retrospective

To cap off your first sprint, you'll participate in a [sprint review and retrospective](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#retrospective-and-sprint-review) facilitated by your mentor.

### Sprint Kickoff

To get started on your next sprint, go through the [sprint kickoff](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#sprint-kickoff) activities of prioritization and estimation. Do this individually, and be sure to discuss your plan with your mentor during your project review.

### Project Review

During class, you'll spend 15-20 minutes with your mentor reviewing your project work to-date. This will be less of a pair programming exercise, and more of a code review exercise. Your mentor will check in with you on things like:

- What stories have you been working on recently?
- What code design decisions did you make, and why? For example, how did you design your model classes and controllers?
- What has been the most challenging aspect of your project so far? How did you overcome it?
- What are you working on next? Your mentor will provide some tips for your next set up stories.
