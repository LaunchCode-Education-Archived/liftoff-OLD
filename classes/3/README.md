We will talk about popular online profiles, like LinkedIn and Github. We'll also discuss why online profiles are necessary, and how they should be presented. We will have examples, and take questions.

### Activity: Resume Workshop

You will have time to work on your resume, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn. If you haven't started a technical resume yet, you'll be able to start based on some example shared in the prep work. If you have an existing resume, you can pair up with a partner or your mentor to get feedback.
