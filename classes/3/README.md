## Project Module: GitHub Best Practices

We'll discuss using Git and GitHub at a more advanced level than you're used to, including branches, remotes, undoing changes, and "Git hygiene".

## Career Module: Online Profiles

Today's career module in-class activity will consist of a discussion around Online Profiles: resume, Github, and LinkedIn.

In our small groups we will create a README.md file for our project. If you have never added a README.md file to a Github please follow [this guide](../../articles/github-readme/).

You will then use the remaining class time to work on your project, or review any of the coursework so far.

### Lecture: How do I finish my project?

In today's class we will talk about making constant progress on our projects, and some additional tools to keep you organized and tracking your progress.

### Activity: User story/wireframe refining, GitHub, and Sprint Kickoff!

For the remaining classes we will have a standup meeting every class in which you will be requried to share with the group the user stories, and wireframes you completed that week. In order to be marked present you must complete at least one user story!

For our first activity you will have a chance to further refine your user stories, and wireframes with your mentor, setup your GitHub repo for your project if you haven't already, and finally have your first standup meeting!

### Regroup: Agile Refresher, Liftoff Expectations, Project Review next week!

Next week we will have our first project review, your instructor will fill you in on how important your project review is. Classes moving forward will have far less in class time for you to work on your project, so you will have to work on your project outside of class!

### Lecture: Online Profiles

We will talk about why online profiles are necessary, and how they should be presented. We will have examples, and take questions.

### Activity: Online Profiles

You will have time to work on your resume, GitHub, and LinkedIn. If you already have them and they are up to LaunchCode Expectations you can go ahead and have your Mentor grade them to get this assignment out of the way. If you don't get them graded in class you will be required to submit them before next class.
