## Project Module: GitHub Best Practices

We'll discuss using Git and GitHub at a more advanced level than you're used to, including branches, remotes, undoing changes, and "Git hygiene".

## Career Module: Online Profiles

Today's career module in class activity will consist of a discussion around Online Profiles: Resume, Github, and LinkedIn.

In our small groups we will create a README.md file for our project. If you have never added a README.md file to a Github please follow [this guide](../../articles/github-readme/).

You will then use the remaining class time to work on your project, or review any of the coursework so far.

## Project Setup

You will have time within class to work on setting up your project's repository and adding your first commits. Get started by working through the [Project Setup](../../assignments/project-setup/) assignment, which includes directions for submission even if you've already started a project.

Be sure to focus on:
- Getting a basic, working project into your repository with an early first commit.
- Getting help from your mentor if you need direction
- Gaining early momentum on your project by working regularly, making lots of small commits, and completing user stories
