## Project Module: Github Best Practices

## Career Module: Online Profiles

Today's career module in class activity will consist of a discussion around Online Profiles: Resume, Github, and LinkedIn.

In our small groups we will create a README.md file for our project. If you have never added a README.md file to a Github please follow [this guide](../../articles/github-readme).

You will then use the remaining class time to work on your project, or review any of the coursework so far.
