## Project Module: GitHub Best Practices

We'll discuss using Git and GitHub at a more advanced level than you're used to, including branches, remotes, undoing changes, and "Git hygiene".

## Career Module: Online Profiles

Today's career module in-class activity will consist of a discussion around Online Profiles: resume, Github, and LinkedIn.

In our small groups we will create a README.md file for our project. If you have never added a README.md file to a Github please follow [this guide](../../articles/github-readme/).

You will then use the remaining class time to work on your project, or review any of the coursework so far.

## Agile: Sprint Retrospective

Now that our first sprint has come to an end, we need to have a [sprint retrospective](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#retrospective-and-sprint-review). This gives us a chance to review what we have done, and discuss how we can do things better in the future!

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you completed this sprint.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you planned to finish, but couldn't this sprint. Briefly mention what blocked you, and how you can resolve the issue next sprint.
- What you learned.

## Project Module: Project Setup

You will have time within class to work on setting up your project's repository and adding your first commits. Get started by working through the [Project Setup](../../assignments/project-setup/) assignment, which includes directions for submission even if you've already started a project.

Be sure to focus on:
- Getting a basic, working project into your repository with an early first commit
- Getting help from your mentor if you need direction
- Gaining early momentum on your project by working regularly, making lots of small commits and completing user stories

## Agile: Sprint Kickoff

We have reviewed our last sprint, and now we need to plan our work for the next sprint. A [sprint kickoff](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#sprint-kickoff) is your chance to decide what you will be working on this sprint.

Take a few minutes to look over your user stories. If you still have plenty of user stories, work on prioritizing those stories. You should choose user stories that have a higher priority for this sprint. If you don't have many user stories, take some time to write new user stories.

When you are ready for the Sprint Kickoff be prepared to:
- Talk about the user stories you are planning on completing this sprint.
- Discuss the priority of these stories.
- Set a goal to have X number of stories completed by next week to discuss in the Standup.
