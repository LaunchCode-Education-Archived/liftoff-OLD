During class 6, we'll discuss Agile development in greater depth.

Additionally, you'll conduct at [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) to update your team on your project work mid-sprint.

Finally, you'll participate in a [mock interview](../../assignments/mock-interview/) that is also an assignment. You must successfully complete the mock interview in order to pass the class.
