## Project Module

During class 6, we'll discuss Agile development in greater depth.

Additionally, you'll conduct at [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) to update your team on your project work mid-sprint.

You will also have access to your mentor, other students, and the staff instructors, so use this time to gain momentum on your project.

## Career Module

Finally, you'll participate in a [mock interview](../../assignments/mock-interview/) that is also an assignment. You must successfully complete the mock interview in order to pass the class.

This is an assignment, and you will be marked as pass or fail. If you fail the assignment you will need to make up the mock interview with a LaunchCode staff member in one of the final classes.
