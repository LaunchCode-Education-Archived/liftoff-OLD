### Activity: Standup

Before the instructor begins their lesson take time to have your standup meeting. Go around and talk about the user stories you completed this previous week, and the user stories you will work on this coming week.

### Lecture: Technical Interviews

In class today we will see a presentation by the instructor. They will be sharing their experiences with interviewing for technical roles. We will also go over how to answer questions effectively, and how to prepare for an interview.

### Activity: Technical Interview Practice

For our activity today you will be paired with another student. You will take turns asking each other example interview questions, and giving each other feedback.

### Project work time

There will probably be some time at the end of class today for you to work on your project. If you are stuck on something, or need help from a mentor don't hesitate using this time to make progress on your project.
