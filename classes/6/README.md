## Project Module

During class 6, we'll discuss Agile development in greater depth. Outside of this discussion you should try to make as much progress on your project as possible.

## Agile: Standup

Additionally, you'll conduct at [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) to update your team on your project work mid-sprint.

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you have completed so far this sprint.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you need to focus on to finish the sprint.
- Anything blocking your progress for a given user story.

## Career Module

Finally, you'll participate in a [mock interview](../../assignments/mock-interview/) that is also an assignment. You must successfully complete the mock interview in order to pass the class.

This is an assignment, and you will be marked as pass or fail. If you fail the assignment, you will need to make up the mock interview with a LaunchCode staff member in one of the final classes.
