## Project Module
Work on your project!

You will have access to your mentor, other students, and the staff instructors use this time to gain momentum on your project.

## Career Module
For our career module work today we will be having mock interviews.

Your mock interview should take no longer than 20 minutes, and the interviewer is giving you a chance to practice what we worked on in class last week.

Interviewing is a necessary skill to getting an apprenticeship through LaunchCode so we want to make sure you have a little practice before interviewing with an actual company.

This is an assignment, and you will be marked as pass or fail. If you fail the assignment you will need to make up the mock interview with a LaunchCode staff member in one of the final classes.
