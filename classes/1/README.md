## Project Module

### Writing Good User Stories

Let's get some practice writing user stories, so that you're ready to go when you start writing them for your own project. We'll consider a fictional company, with a fictional project, and work through the process together.

#### An Attendance App

In this fictional scenario, your team has been contract to build a new app for LaunchCode. As part of the planning process, you will write the first set up user stories. These will guide your team's work, and will serve to communicate to developers what the project's requirements are in a way that aligns with the business requirements.

The project is to build a system that allows LaunchCode course staff to easily take attendance during classes. The current system involves a less-than-desireable work-around in Canvas, and LaunchCode wants a better tool.

#### Gathering Requirements

As a class, you need to determine from the client (i.e. LaunchCode Education staff) what they need. Begin by asking questions. In particular, you should determine:

- What are the personnas, or user types, that will be using the app?
- What actions should each user type be able to carry out?

#### Drafting Some Stories

Now that you've gotten input from the client, write 5 user stories that you would use to begin development.

#### Coordinating With the Client

Once you write user stories, you should clarify all stories with the client. 

- As you were writing them, did any questions arise that you didn't consider when initially gathering requirements? 
- Do the stories that you drafted align with the client's actual desired features? 
- Are your user stories too big? Are they "epics" that need to be broken down into smaller stories?

As you talk through these with the client, adjust and improve user stories based on feedback.

### Continued Education

#### Gathering Resources
Moving forward you are responsible for your own learning journey. This has pros and cons. No one is going to tell you what to learn, or provide you with any resources on how to learn. However, you get to choose what you want to learn, and can get to choose your own resources!

If you haven't already it's time to begin creating a list of topics, programming langauges, and technologies you want to learn, and resources to learn them from.

We discussed multiple ways of continuing to learn as a developer including:
- Using Online Resources
- Reading Books
- Building Projects
- Attending Conferences
- Attending Meetups

#### Using Meetup.com

As an assignment in class today we are going to sign up for Meetup.com, and RSVP for a meetup.

If you do not already have a Meetup.com account you can create one on their [website](https://secure.meetup.com/register/).

After creating your account:
1. Search for technical meetups
2. Select a meetup that matches a skill you have, or are trying to learn
3. Find the next event in the Meetup series
4. RSVP for the event
5. Mark your personal calendar

Meetups are a great place to learn new concepts, and to meet new programming professionals. Often times the people you meet at meetups will help you identify great resources for learning more about any given topic!
