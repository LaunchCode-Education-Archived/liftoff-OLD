## Project Module

### Writing Good User Stories

Let's get some practice writing user stories and creating wireframes so that you're ready to go when you are creating them for your own project. We'll consider a fictional company, with a fictional project, and work through the process together.

#### An Attendance App

In this fictional scenario, your team has been contracted to build a new app for LaunchCode. As part of the planning process, you will write the first set up user stories and wireframes. These will guide your team's work, and will serve to communicate to developers what the project's requirements are in a way that aligns with the business requirements.

The project is to build a system that allows LaunchCode course staff to easily take attendance during classes. The current system involves a less-than-desirable work-around in Canvas, and LaunchCode wants a better tool.

#### Gathering Requirements

As a class, you need to determine from the client (i.e. LaunchCode Education staff) what they need. Begin by asking questions. In particular, you should determine:

- What are the personnas, or user types, that will be using the app?
- What actions should each user type be able to carry out?

#### Drafting Some Stories

Now that you've gotten input from the client, write 5 user stories that you would use to begin development.

#### Coordinating With the Client

Once you write user stories, you should clarify all stories with the client. 

- As you were writing them, did any questions arise that you didn't consider when initially gathering requirements?
- Do the stories that you drafted align with the client's actual desired features?
- Are your user stories too big? Are they "epics" that need to be broken down into smaller stories?

As you talk through these with the client, adjust and improve user stories and wireframes based on feedback.

## Agile: Sprint Kickoff

Now that we have an understanding of User Stories, and the upcoming assignments we need to have a [Sprint Kickoff](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#sprint-kickoff) to determine what we will be doing in our sprint. Take some time to consider what you will need to do in order to complete the Project Outline assignment, and the work you may need to complete for your project next week. You will then go around the group and everyone will state what they will be working on. You should leave the meeting knowing which user stories you need to work on.

When you are ready for the Sprint Kickoff be prepared to:
- Talk about the user stories you are planning on completing this sprint.
- Discuss the priority of these stories.
- Set a goal to have X number of stories completed by next week to discuss in the Standup. **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
