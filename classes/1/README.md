### Writing Good User Stories

Let's get some practice writing user stories and creating wireframes so that you're ready to go when you are creating them for your own project. We'll consider a fictional company, with a fictional project, and work through the process together.

#### An Attendance App

In this fictional scenario, your team has been contracted to build a new app for LaunchCode. As part of the planning process, you will write the first set up user stories and wireframes. These will guide your team's work, and will serve to communicate to developers what the project's requirements are in a way that aligns with the business requirements.

The project is to build a system that allows LaunchCode course staff to easily take attendance during classes. The current system involves a less-than-desireable work-around in Canvas, and LaunchCode wants a better tool.

#### Gathering Requirements

As a class, you need to determine from the client (i.e. LaunchCode Education staff) what they need. Begin by asking questions. In particular, you should determine:

- What are the personnas, or user types, that will be using the app?
- What actions should each user type be able to carry out?

#### Drafting Some Stories

Now that you've gotten input from the client, write 5 user stories that you would use to begin development.

#### Coordinating With the Client

Once you write user stories, you should clarify all stories with the client. 

- As you were writing them, did any questions arise that you didn't consider when initially gathering requirements? 
- Do the stories that you drafted align with the client's actual desired features? 
- Are your user stories too big? Are they "epics" that need to be broken down into smaller stories?

As you talk through these with the client, adjust and improve user stories and wireframes based on feedback.
