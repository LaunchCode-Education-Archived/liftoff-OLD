## Project Module: Project Process and Tools

### Lecture: How do you visualize a user story?

In class today we will have a lecture and discussion on how to visualize a user story. The intended user for application will more than likely be expecting something on their screen to interact with. How can we plan/design what their screens will look like?

Before lecture today please take a few minutes to think about what your project looks like to an end user. What do they need to see to use your application?

### Activity: Design your wireframes!

Take this time to draw wireframes for your project check in with your mentor, talk about your wireframes with other people in your group, you might find that some of your wireframes look similar!

### Lecture: How do you take a user story, and wireframe and turn it into code?

The Instructor will give a brief presentation on a Most Viable Product (MVP), and will give a live demonstration of completing a user story and wireframe.

### Activity: Plan you MVP and check in with your Mentor!

Use this time in class to polish your user stories, and wireframes so you have an MVP. Share your plans with your Mentor. You should be able to walk them through how a user interacts with your application by talking through the user stories, and showing the wireframes.

### Regroup: Instructor Demo, and Questions
