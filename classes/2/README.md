## Project Module: Project Process and Tools

We will continue with planning work for the [attendance app](../1/) introduced in class 1.

The instructor will present some user stories, and you will use these to generate some wireframes within your groups.

## Career Module: Live Coding One

Today's career module in class activity has two parts.

1. Your group will walk through a live coding problem together under the supervision of your mentor. You will need to go through all the steps, and find a solution to the problem. This is a chance for you to ask questions, and learn from your fellow classmates.

2. You will be paried with someone in a different group that worked on a different problem. In your pair you will take turns practicing a live coding session. One of you will act as the interviewer, and one of you will attempt to solve the problem as the interviewee. After working through the problem you will switch roles.
