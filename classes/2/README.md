## Project Module: Project Process and Tools

We will continue with planning work for the [attendance app](../1/) introduced in class 1.

The instructor will present some user stories, and you will use these to generate some wireframes within your groups.

Additionally, you will conduct a [Sprint standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) this will give everyone to discuss what they were able to accomplish in the first half of their sprint, and what they aim to complete in the remainder of the sprint.

## Career Module: Live Coding One

Today's career module in class activity has two parts.

1. Your group will walk through a live coding problem together under the supervision of your mentor. You will need to go through all the steps, and find a solution to the problem. This is a chance for you to ask questions, and learn from your fellow classmates.

2. You will be paired with someone in a different group that worked on a different problem. In your pair you will take turns practicing a live coding session. One of you will act as the interviewer, and one of you will attempt to solve the problem as the interviewee. After working through the problem, you will switch roles.

## Agile: Sprint Standup

Now that our first sprint is halfway over it is time to have a [Sprint Standup](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) to quickly review what we have done so far, and focus on what we need to accomplish to finish this sprint. 

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you have completed so far.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you will be working on for the remainder of the sprint.
- Anything blocking your progress.
- What you have learned so far this sprint.
