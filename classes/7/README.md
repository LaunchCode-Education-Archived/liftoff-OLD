## Agile: Sprint Review and Retrospective

Additionally, you'll conduct a [Sprint Retro](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#retrospective-and-sprint-review) to close down the sprint.

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you completed this sprint.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you planned to finish, but couldn't this sprint. Briefly mention what blocked you, and how you can resolve the issue next sprint.
- What you learned.

## Project Module

In class 7, we'll discuss [Project Presentation](../../assignments/project-presentation/). This assignment is a way for you to start organizing your thoughts around your project. This will help prepare yourself to talk about your project with other developers. Outside of the project presentation you should focus on completing as many user stories as possible for your project.

## Agile: Sprint Kickoff

We have reviewed our last sprint, and now we need to plan our work for our final sprint. A [sprint kickoff](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#sprint-kickoff) is your chance to decide what you will be working on this sprint.

Take a few minutes to look over your user stories. If you still have plenty of user stories, work on prioritizing those stories. You should choose user stories that have a higher priority for this sprint. If you don't have many user stories, take some time to write new user stories.

When you are ready for the Sprint Kickoff be prepared to:
- Talk about the user stories you are planning on completing this sprint.
- Discuss the priority of these stories.
- Set a goal to have X number of stories completed by next week to discuss in the Standup.

## Career Module

There is no new Career Module work. If you need to make up a Mock Interview, or Live Coding assignment, free time will be provided. Check your grades on Canvas, if you are missing a grade, or have a 0 for Live Coding, or Mock Interview ask your Mentor if you can make up one of these assignments.
