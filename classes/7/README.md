## Project Module

In class 7, we'll discuss [Project Presentation](../../assignments/project-presentation/). This assignment is a way for you to start organizing your thoughts around your project. This will help prepare yourself to talk about your project with other developers.

Additionally, you'll conduct a [Sprint Retro](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#retrospective-and-sprint-review) to close down the sprint.

After closing downt the sprint you will be able to have a new [Sprint Kickoff](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#sprint-kickoff). This will be the final sprint for the class, so spend extra time reflecting on what you have learned from your previous sprints.

You will also have access to your mentor, other students, and the staff instructors, so use this time to gain momentum on your project.

## Career Module

There is no new Career Module work. If you need to make up a Mock Interview, or Live Coding assignment, free time will be provided. Ask your Mentor if you can make up one of these assignments.
