## Project Module: Standup

Your focus for the project module this week, and going forward, should be on making as much progress on your project as possible each week.

This week, you will participate in your first [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) with your group. Make the most of the time to communicate your progress, and to learn about the progress of your peers.

1. Gather Requirements/Clarify the Problem
2. Break Complex Problems into Smaller Simple Problems

Today for live coding, we are going to split into pairs. Again you will be taking the role of interviewer, and interviewee. Continue practicing live coding with one another, going over the steps, communciating effectively, and working towards a solution to the problem.
