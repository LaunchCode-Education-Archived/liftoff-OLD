## Project Module: Project Progress

Your focus for the project module this week, and going forward, should be on making as much progress on your project as possible each week. If you have completed the user stories you planned in a given sprint, pull more stories from your backlog/icebox. If your backlog/icebox is full, write more user stories.

## Agile: Sprint Standup

We are halfway through our sprint, it is time to have a [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup).

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you have completed so far.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you need to focus on to finish the sprint.
- Anything blocking your progress for a given user story.

## Career Module: Live Coding Two

Live Coding Overview:

1. Gather Requirements/Clarify the Problem
2. Break Complex Problems into Smaller Simple Problems
3. Pseudocode, Talk Through the Logic
4. Code
5. Test & Make Changes

Today for live coding, we are going to split into pairs. Again you will be taking the role of interviewer and interviewee. Continue practicing live coding with one another, going over the steps, communicating effectively, and working towards a solution to the problem.

This time can also be used to complete the Live Coding Assignment. If you have scheduled a time with your mentor or a LaunchCode staff member, we can give you a chance to complete the assignment.
