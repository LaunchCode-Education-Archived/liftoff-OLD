## Project Module

In class 8, we'll discuss Project Deployment. You will not be responsbile for deploying your project in this course, but you will need to know about the concept.

Additionally, you'll conduct at [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup) to update your team on your project work mid-sprint.

You will also have access to your mentor, other students, and the staff instructors, so use this time to gain momentum on your project.

## Career Module

As a final topic we will be discussing Continued Education. We will address topics like learning in the apprenticehsip, learning outside of a structured class, and joining additional coding communities.

Time will be provided to make up previous Career Module assignments like Mock Interviews, and Live Coding.
