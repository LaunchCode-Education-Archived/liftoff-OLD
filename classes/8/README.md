### Activity: Standup

Before we get started take a minute to have your standup meeting.

### Regroup: Instructor to introduce Continued Education Activity

For our final class today we want to talk about continued education. You must continue learning on your own after this class, and you must continue learning on the job. We will talk about how to do this.

### Activity: Continued Education

We have done multiple things for this in the past, we have had panels of speakers, we have compiled lists of learning resources together, we have had space to work with our mentors to develop learning plans, etc.

### Regroup: Project Review

As a final activity for LaunchCode you will be having a final project review. Your instructor will introduce this activity, and give you instructions on how to proceed.

### Activity: Project Review

You will meet with your mentor one on one. They will be reviewing your project. They want to see that you have made significant progress from your first project review 4 weeks ago.

### Free time

With remaining class time make up live coding, or mock interview assignments.
