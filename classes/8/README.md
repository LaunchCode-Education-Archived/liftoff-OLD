## Project Module

In class 8, we'll discuss Project Deployment. You will not be responsbile for deploying your project in this course, but you will need to know about the concept.

## Agile: Sprint Standup

We are halfway through our sprint, it is time to have a [standup meeting](../../articles/agile-ceremonies/#standup).

Be prepared to talk about:
- The user stories you have completed so far.  **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
- The user stories you need to focus on to finish the sprint.
- Anything blocking your progress for a given user story.

## Career Module

As a final topic we will be discussing Continued Education. We will address topics like learning in the apprenticehsip, learning outside of a structured class, and joining additional coding communities.

Time will be provided to make up previous assignments like Mock Interviews, Live Coding, and Project Reviews. Check your grades on Canvas, if you are missing any of these assignments talk to your mentor about making them up in class.
