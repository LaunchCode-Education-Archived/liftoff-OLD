## Project Module

There is no additional prep work for the project module for this week. Be sure that you complete the [Project Setup assignment](../../assignments/project-setup/) and put in at least 10-15 hours on your project, so you can build momentum.

## Career Module: Live Coding Two

Task | Resource Type | Link | Instructions
|----|---------------|------|-------------|
Read/Do | Article | [Live Coding Practice](../../articles/live-coding/) | This article links out to 4 different problems for you to practice on.

## Agile: Standup Preparation
Take inventory of the user stories you have completed so far. Update your Pivotal Tracker to reflect any changes. Be prepared to talk about:
- User stories you have completed.
- User stories you are still working on.
- Any blockers you have encountered so far.

You will be expected to talk about all three of these things in your Standup with your group during class 4. **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
