## Overview: Live Coding, Project Review
Class 4 is an important class. We will start shifting our in class focus from your project to career readiness. You will still be expected to work on your project outside of class. 

You will have a project review with your mentor. They will be checking in on the progress of your project. Your mentor knows it's a work in progress, and doesn't expect everything to be perfect, or even completed. Your mentor wants to see what you have completed so far. *If you haven't written any code and have nothing to show you will be dropped from the course.*

### Project Review
The Project Review is very important, you need to make constant progress on your project to show employers you are ready for a job. We want to ensure you are making progress, and will do so with a Project Review.

In your class 4 Project Review *your application should have the following in order to remain enrolled in the class*:
1. A working landing page
2. At least one functioning and complete user story

You are more than welcome to show off multiple completed user stories, and multiple pages, but you must have at least a working landing page, and one function and complete user story to pass this assignment, and to stay enrolled in the class.

*The best way to prepare for this meeting is to spend a lot of time working on your project*, so you will have no extra prep work outside of the Live Coding prep work listed below.

### Live Coding
