## Overview: Live Coding, Project Review
Class 4 is an important class. We will start shifting our in class focus from your project to career readiness. You will still be expected to work on your project outside of class. 

You will have a project review with your mentor. They will be checking in on the progress of your project. Your mentor knows it's a work in progress, and doesn't expect everything to be perfect, or even completed. Your mentor wants to see what you have completed so far. *If you haven't written any code and have nothing to show you will be dropped from the course.*

### Project Review
You will have a brief one on one meeting with your mentor in class. Be prepared to show them what your project can do! We would recommend showing off what your project currently looks like from the user's perspective, you can show them the login system, or the CRUD functionality, or how it draws in data from an API, etc.

*The best way to prepare for this meeting is to spend a lot of time working on your project*, so you will have no extra prep work outside of the Live Coding prep work listed below.

### Live Coding
Live coding is a part of the interview process. The best way to prepare for live coding is to practice, practice, practice. Today we will see a strategy for solving live coding problems, we will get more practice in class.
