## Project Module: Agile Refresher
### Agile Standup
Every class we will be going through at least one agile cermony. This week we are going through a *Standup*. This is the mid sprint meeting. Traditionally you would have a standup meeting everyday, and it would be very brief. Each developer would go around the circle and state what they accomplished the day before, what they are working on today, and anything that is blocking their work from happening. We will be doing the same thing, but talking about our entire week. This will give you a chance to evaluate how much you have accomplished over the first half of the sprint, what you need to focus on for the second half of the sprint, and to share ideas with the other developers in your group. If you have solved a problem someone else is having offer to help them out by showing them how you got it done! This meeting will also give your mentor a chance to check in on your progress.
