There is no new prep for class 6. Be prepared for your mock interview during class 6, and continue working hard on your project!

## Agile: Standup Preparation
Take inventory of the user stories you have completed so far. Update your Pivotal Tracker to reflect any changes. Be prepared to talk about:
- User stories you have completed.
- User stories you are still working on.
- Any blockers you have encountered so far.

You will be expected to talk about all three of these things in your Standup with your group during class 6. **We expect you to complete at least one user story every week.**
