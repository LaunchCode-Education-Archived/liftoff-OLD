There is no new prep for class 6. Be prepared for your mock interview during class 6, and continue working hard on your project!

## Interviews

Interviewing is crucial to actually land a job as a developer. In class we will discuss the different aspects of the interview process and how to prepare for each part of the interview.

For prep-work, you simply need to start thinking about interviews you've had in the past and read the following articles.

## Demo Projects

The final section of your assigned prep work each week will be links to demo projects created by Chris Bay, and Paul Matthews. They built projects with similar scopes to the project you will be building throughout Liftoff. If you are looking for inspiration, or want to see how Chris, or Paul completed a project assignment you will be able to find that here, or by visiting the [demo-project](../../demo-projects/) page. You will also find writeups of what they discussed in their agile ceremony meetings, it would be to your benefit to read what they discussed as you prepare for your weekly agile ceremnonies.
