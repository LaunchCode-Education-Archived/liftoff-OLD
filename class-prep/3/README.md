## Collaboration

This week's project module is really about two different topics, both of which loosely fall under the guise of collaborating on project work. We'll look at some intermediate Git and GitHub topics, and also learn a bit about licensing.

### Intermediate Git

You've become comfortable with using Git for version control on you projects and assignments, however, you likely haven't used the same Git repository to collaborate with others. It should come as no surprise to you that in the professional, developers are working in the same code base all of the time!

Aside from tracking your changes to a project, Git also enables efficient collaboration with others. This means that there are mechanisms for combining different groups of changes (merging), for sharing code remotely (using remote repositories), and for carrying out different sets of tasks within the same repository (branching). We'll learn about these

### Licensing

As a software developer, almost anything you create is your own **intellectual property**. This means that you own it, and thus have control over whether or not others can use it. Similarly, when you use software or code written by other people, you are only doing so via their permission. Licenses are legal tools used to specify who can use softare, and how. As a developer, it is critically important that you are aware of licenses, and that you follow them properly when using code written by others.

While your first instinct may be to prevent others from using your work, that is often not the best choice. Many software developers and companies choose to allow others to use their code, which is great! Think about some of the tools, libraries, and frameworks that you've used throughout your learning. Most, if not all, of these were used legally via **open source licenses**. Such licenses ensure that developers can share and use code appropriately, and make the world of development a better place for everyone!

Read | Article | [The Legal Side of Open Source](https://opensource.guide/legal/) | Read sections 1-4 of this guide to learn about some of the legal basics behind open licensing. If you're more interested in licensing, continue through the end of the article, and check out some of the other articles on this site.
Browse | Site | [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) | This site is great tool than can help you determine which license to apply to your project based on how you want to allow others to use it. Have a look, and read about some of the licenses that it recommends for various purposes.
