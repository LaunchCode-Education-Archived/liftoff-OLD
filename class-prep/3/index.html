<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>This week's project module is really about two different topics, both of which loosely fall under the guise of collaborating on project work. We'll look at some intermediate Git and GitHub topics and we'll learn a bit about licensing.</p>
<h3 id="intermediate-git">Intermediate Git</h3>
<p>You've become comfortable with using Git for version control on your projects and assignments; however, you likely haven't used the same Git repository to collaborate with others. It should come as no surprise to you that in the professional tech world, developers are working in the same code base all the time!</p>
<p>Aside from tracking your changes to a project, Git also enables efficient collaboration with others. This means that there are mechanisms for combining different groups of changes (<em>merging</em>), for sharing code remotely (<em>using remote repositories</em>), and for carrying out different sets of tasks within the same repository (<em>branching</em>). We'll learn about these in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="licensing">Licensing</h3>
<p>As a software developer, almost anything you create is your own <strong>intellectual property</strong>. This means that you own it and thus have control over whether or not others can use it. Similarly, when you use software or code written by other people, you are only doing so via their permission. Licenses are legal tools used to specify who can use software, and how. As a developer, it is critically important that you are aware of licenses, and that you follow them properly when using code written by others.</p>
<p>While your first instinct may be to prevent others from using your work, that is often not the best choice. Many software developers and companies choose to allow others to use their code, which is great! Think about some of the tools, libraries, and frameworks that you've used throughout your learning. Most, if not all, of these were used legally via <strong>open source licenses</strong>. Such licenses ensure that developers can share and use code appropriately, making the world of development a better place for everyone!</p>

<h2 id="online-profiles">Online Profiles</h2>
<p>This week's career module focuses on the profiles companies will view before and during the interview process. We will manipulate these profiles in a way that will assist you during your job search. For prep-work we will examine the following: a resume, a GitHub profile, and a LinkedIn profile. We will go over what makes the profile good and highlight where the profile can be improved. This will give us a list of things to include as well as things to leave out of each profile.</p>
