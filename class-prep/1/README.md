To hit the ground running in class one we need to cover a lot of ground! We need to **set up our GitHub repository** so we can upload our assignments, we need to learn about the **three Agile ceremonies** we will use in this class, we need to learn about **user stories**, and **wireframing**, and finally we need to understand what makes a **good capstone project**. We want to handle as much setup and logistical work as possible now so the remaining weeks of the class we can focus on making progress on our projects!

## Project Module: Agile

### Project Organization

You may have heard the term "agile" before, but likely don't have a good idea of what it means in reference to software development. We'll dig into agile in a later module, but for now you should now that it is a general category of software development and team organization practices.

We are going to use some of the most basic agile planning and communications practices throughout this course. In agile development, **ceremonies** are formal planning and communication activities that are organized around a **sprint**. Sprints are simply time-bound windows of work. For example, teams may choose to have 1-week, 2-week, or 4-week sprints, and each sprint includes the ceremonies described in the article below.

We will use the concept of a sprint, along with the associated ceremonies, within the Liftoff course.

Most agile articles (including the one below) are littered with jargon that can be difficult to wrap your head around at first. Don't focus much on all of the terminology, but instead on the 4 basic ceremonies and the role they play in project planning and execution.

## Project Module: User Stories

|----|---------------|------|-------------|
Read | Article | [What Is A User Story?](https://www.leadingagile.com/2012/07/user-story/) | Read this brief introduction to the concept of user stories. User stories are a technique of defining work items. They are often discussed in the content of "Agile development", but are not the same as Agile. We'll learn more about Agile in a future lesson, but for now, focus on the concept of a user story as a stand-alone tool.
Read | Article | [10 Tips for Writing Good User Stories](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/) | Read about writing great user stories for your project
Setup | Tool | [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/) | Create a free account for the Pivotal Tracker tool. We'll use this to track our user stories. Once you have an account, create a public project for your capstone project.


## Project Module: Wireframing
### UX

UX is short for "user experience", and is the design discipline focused on making products that place primary importance on a user's experiences and interactions. A critical part of the UX design process is wireframing, which is a technique used to sketch out web pages and views in a rough way that focuses on how elements are arranged and how users are likely to interact with them.

This isn't a design class, and most developers work with designers to create the best products possible. While you won't be expected to be an expert at UX and design, it is important to have an appreciation for the elements of design and have a user focus when working on your project.

## Demo Projects

The final section of your assigned prep work each week will be links to demo projects created by Chris Bay, and Paul Matthews. They built projects with similar scopes to the project you will be building throughout Liftoff. If you are looking for inspiration, or want to see how Chris, or Paul completed a project assignment you will be able to find that here, or by visiting the [demo-project](../../demo-projects/) page. You will also find writeups of what they discussed in their agile ceremony meetings, it would be to your benefit to read what they discussed as you prepare for your weekly agile ceremnonies.
