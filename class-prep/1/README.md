To hit the ground running in class one we need to cover a lot of ground! We need to **set up our GitHub repository** so we can upload our assignments, we need to understand what makes a **good capstone project**, and finally we need to learn about **user stories**. We want to handle as much setup and logistical work as possible now so the remaining weeks of the class we can focus on making progress on our projects!

## Project Module: Capstone Overview

We will spend time in class talking about project ideas in small groups. Come to class with 2 or 3 ideas for projects you might want to work on. If you are struggling to come up with ideas check out the [demo project write-ups](../../demo-projects) or [project demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LRJHkTqsg&list=PLs5n5nYB22fIdV_HMkekxx7Yt06lXUptT)

## Demo Projects

Your assigned prep work each week will include links to demo projects created by Chris Bay, and Paul Matthews. They built projects with similar scopes to the project you will be building throughout Liftoff. If you are looking for inspiration, or want to see how Chris, or Paul completed a project assignment you will be able to find that here, or by visiting the [demo-project](../../demo-projects/) page. You will also find writeups of what they discussed in their agile ceremony meetings, it would be to your benefit to read what they discussed as you prepare for your weekly agile ceremnonies.

Read | Article | [What Is A User Story?](https://www.leadingagile.com/2012/07/user-story/) | Read this brief introduction to the concept of user stories. User stories are a technique of defining work items. They are often discussed in the content of "Agile development", but are not the same as Agile. We'll learn more about Agile in a future lesson, but for now, focus on the concept of a user story as a stand-alone tool.

Setup | Tool | [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/) | Create a free account for the Pivotal Tracker tool. We'll use this to track our user stories. Once you have an account, create a public project for your capstone project.
