As with last week, your focus this week should be on making progress on your project. It's critical at this juncture for you to gain some momentum and to leverage your mentor to get unstuck when things become difficult.

The following articles provide some good perspective and tips on being a budding developer, getting help, and working with a mentor. *Your main focus should be on working as much as possible on your project!*

## Demo Projects

The final section of your assigned prep work each week will be links to demo projects created by Chris Bay, and Paul Matthews. They built projects with similar scopes to the project you will be building throughout Liftoff. If you are looking for inspiration, or want to see how Chris, or Paul completed a project assignment you will be able to find that here, or by visiting the [demo-project](../../demo-projects/) page. You will also find writeups of what they discussed in their agile ceremony meetings, it would be to your benefit to read what they discussed as you prepare for your weekly agile ceremnonies.
